# About me

## The basics

<img src="/images/tamas-kuti-avatar.jpeg" alt="Portrait of Tamás Kuti" class="profile-image" />

I'm a self-taught developer born and raised in Budapest, Hungary. I have a firm background in UI design and front-end development, but I don't shy away from back-end and even devOps related tasks if it comes to that.

I describe myself as a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none, full-stack developer, who always focuses on delivering value to all stakeholders of the project in question.

## The details

My bread and butter is CSS+HTML, since this is what I've started out with way back in 2009.
Since then I've been constantly picking up new languages, frameworks, libraries, whatever it takes to get the job done.

I believe in constant learning and not to be defined by my tools. I can pick up new technologies quite fast. That being said, here's a brief (but non-exhaustive) list of technologies I've used the most or enjoy using today.

## What can I do you for?

I'm available for freelance work, either to be embedded in your existing dev team or to work on small-scale MVP projects.
I prefer to work remotely (my time zone is GMT+3), but we can discuss shorter on-site visits as well.

## On a more personal note…

Currently I live in sunny Bulgaria with my [fiancée](https://dimana-shishkova.jimdosite.com/) and our [four-legged companion](https://www.instagram.com/todordogstoevsky/). When I'm away from the keyboard, I practice the gentle art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, try to break my neck on a skateboard, do some running or just hike in our beautiful surroundings with the aforementioned fiancée and dog.
